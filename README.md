# RockScissorPaperAgent

The main goal of this project is to create an AI Agent that could be used to predict the winning moves in the Rock-Scissor Paper game, using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques.
The AI agent will review the opponent's move using an image taken from his hand, classify his move and propose the winning move.
The AI Agent will be compared from a Random Agent which will randomly classify each opponent's move in one of the three possible outcomes, thus it will resemble the baseline estimator, expecting to achieve approximately 34% accuracy. For making the predictions of the winning move from our AI Agent even harder, the Random Agent will apply various transformations in the input image, such as rotation, vertical & horizontal flipping and added noise.
For the AI Agent, various workflows implemented, some of them are listed below:  

Load RGB images in Grayscale and RGB format.
Transform images with operations like rotation, vertical & horizontal flip and added noise.
Resize, scale and split images in Train and Test set.
Dimensionality Reduction through kernel PCA and LDA.
Supervised Learning with Ensemble Models such as Random Forests.
Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search Cross Validation.
Supervised Learning with Deep Learning techniques such as CNNs.
Transfer Learning and Finetuning with Inception model
Evaluation of models using various metrics in Validation and Test set.
Creation of a simulated environment for Rock-Scissor-Paper game and deployment of AI Agent and Random Agent in it.
